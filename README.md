# Compiling Lua
A guide for compiling Lua for Windows, complete with script

## Prerequisites

* A tool capable of extracting `.tar.gz` files
  * I recommend [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
* _Either_
  * A full [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) installation
  * The [standalone Visual Studio build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) (unconfirmed)

## Steps

1. Go to the Lua [download area](https://www.lua.org/ftp/).
2. Download the version of Lua that you want.
3. Unzip the `.tar.gz` file using a decompression tool, giving you a folder of the form `lua-x.y.z`.
    * Where `x.y.z` corresponds to the version number of the Lua version you have downloaded, e.g. `lua-5.3.5`.
    * If you do not have a suitable decompression tool, I recommend [7Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/).
    * You may need to extract twice, once for the `.gz` wrapper and once for the `.tar` archiving.
4. Download the `Compile.bat` file from this repo and move it into the extracted `lua-x.y.z` folder.
5. Make sure you have `cl.exe`, `link.exe` and `lib.exe` either in your [`%PATH%` variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) or in the extracted `lua-x.y.z` folder.
6. Open Developer Comand Prompt that is installed with Visual Studio or run **Change <Release> Depending on your visual studio installation
   ```console
   call "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\<Release>\Community\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat" -arch=x64
   ```
8. Run `Compile.bat` either by double-clicking it or running it from command line.
    * Windows may provide a security warning advising you not to run scripts from untrusted sources. If you have any doubts about whether or not you can trust the script then I advise that you _do not run it_ as I will not be held liable for any damages.
  
After step 6, there should be a copy of `lua.exe`, `luac.exe` and `lua.dll` present in the `lua-x.y.z` folder.
* `lua.exe` is the Lua interpreter, which interprets and runs scripts, and provides a Lua [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) if run without arguments.
* `luac.exe` compiles Lua files into standalone executables.
* `lua.dll` is the library file that holds all the necessary Lua pipelining and must be kept with both `lua.exe` and `luac.exe` in order for them to function correctly.

You may relocate these files as you please, as long as `lua.exe` and `luac.exe` have a copy of `lua.dll` in the same directory in which they are kept.

It is recommended that you put the directory in which these files are kept on your [`%PATH%`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) so that you can run them from the command line.
  
## Legal

The script I have provided is a modified version of the script found on [this blog](https://blog.spreendigital.de/2015/01/16/how-to-compile-lua-5-3-0-for-windows/).
I am not the original author, but I am responsible for the various modifications.
Regretably as the original script has no licence I cannot provide a licence for my modified version as I do not have proper copyright of it.
The original author retains the right to request the removal of my modified version, a request with which I would willingly (if regretfully) comply, but personally I would rather the original author added a proper licence to their original version and possibly even incorporated my modifications, as that would be a more beneficial outcome.

Regardless I will say that:
